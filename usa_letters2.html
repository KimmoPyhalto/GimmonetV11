<h2>Diet</h2>
					
					
				<p class="letters">
					
				Three weeks have passed and daily routines are begin to form. Breakfast consisting of an oatmeal porridge, egg whites and a dark bread is almost as in Finland, except the egg whites feel somehow rubbery and it’s almost impossible to find a dark bread (clearly one of the reasons so many people here are morbidly obese). The situation has forced me to use <a href="http://www.mestemacher-gmbh.com/product-line/diet-and-fitness-breads/fitness-bread" target="_New"><i>a fitness bread</i></a> that is decent, at least when roasted. White or dark, the bread is expensive.

					<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp</div>

<p class="letters">My every day lunch consisting of pre-marinated chicken and cucumber-paprika-salad is transformed into carrots and self-marinated chicken. Cucumber and paprika are awfully expensive and pre-marinated products seem to be rare. Don’t have any knowledge nor interest to do proper marinating, so some Kentucky BBQ-sauce over the chickens will do. Tap water has a strong aroma and taste of chlorine. It’s drinkable (officials say), but I’ve switched to a bottled water (0,25c/l) at least for comfort. </p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>




<p class="letters">I’ve been able to keep my running goal of 30km per week, although running in better areas calls for climbing on top of the huge hill (wonder) and despite the time of the day, you can’t avoid of been running near cars and their fumes. Dust, gases etc. stick into sweaty skin and then between eyes and contact lenses. A perfect way to get an eye infection. Luckily it was just a <i>basic</i> infection not lasting than few days. There’s no any large parks here like Pyynikki or Kauppi. In addition to running, I decided to pay a ridiculous 150 dollar fee for using university’s sport facilities (6 months). In Finland the same fun costs 60 euros for a year. A positive thing is that here you can do almost every imaginable sports (ball games, gym, martial arts, swimming, rock climbing etc.) and the facilities are like everything in America, big. In addition they provide you with a towel and means for playing, like balls and rackets.</p>

<h2>Bicycle</h2>

<p class="letters">Further exercise have been provided by a bicycle I bought and renovated in <a href="http://www.ohiocitycycles.org" target="_New">Ohio City Bicycle Co-op</a>, where people donate their old bikes and others can buy them readily fixed or they can do it by themselves in the community’s shop. No change I would have left without getting my hands dirty. After two hours of bargaining and searching and half an hour of renovation, I had almost mint condition mountain bike for 30 bucks (the new lock was 26 $...). “Roadmaster” is a true American market grade mountain bike, of which kind I haven’t seen in Europe yet (e.g. dual-pivot brakes!?!). So, now the possibility to see the surroundings has increased significantly (I remember, the winter is coming).</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p>Combining the ability to move efficiently, new environment and investigative nature doesn’t help the progression of my research. Just few days ago I left the IRB-suited and more focused research plan to prof. <a href="https://weatherhead.case.edu/faculty/kalle-lyytinen" target="_New">Kalle Lyytinen</a> who is acting as my local supervisor. Due to the salary I have to pay taxes here and that’s why I have to apply for American social security number. As the SSN is lifelong, you may guess that the officials are quite strict about knowing persons backgrounds and their information before assigning it. No luck with my last name and due to different versions in visa (Pyhaeltoe), passport (Pyh&auml;lt&ouml;) and other documents (Pyhalto) the process will take some six weeks to finish. </p>

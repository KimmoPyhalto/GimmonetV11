				Over a month has been passed since last letter, so I will divide things into two. 24.11., my first basketball game in the USA. CWRU Spartans vs. Denison. U.S. College division (NCAA) III (lowest), still formidable playing. Definitely matching our men´s second or third division.

<p class="letters">Couldn´t afford to buy a car, so I joined to the <a href="http://www.enterprisecarshare.com" target="_new">Enterprise Car Share Community</a>, which provides hourly rentals for $8/h. I pity the new car because the roads here are in terrible condition. Only highways are in adequate shape. One of the reasons for the road´s condition is that at least in Cleveland the only thing they use for fighting against the winter is salt, and lots of it. No sand, winter tires, studs etc.. The salt is also effecting the cars: huge rust holes and pick-up´s with half-collapsed frames. The salt combined to the poor protection (=build quality) will take care of the renewal of car pool. 200000+ kilometers and the car is considered junk. Combining this to the common engine types (gasoline, naturally aspirated) and sizes (mostly 3-6+litre V6´s and V8´s), one cannot speak about sustainable development.

			<p class="letters">I was invited Thanksgiving dinner to other PhD student´s home. For the first time I saw the stuffed turkey. The amount of food was something like in Christmas. Could not avoid overeating. Ordered a new wireless running headphones, <a href="https://www.qy-mobile.com/mobi/bluetooth-headsets/matone-qy8-new-version-qy7-v4-1-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-best-in-ear-noise-cancelling-headphones-with-microphone-for-running-sports-exercise-mini-lightweight-sweatproof-stereo-bas" target="New_">Matone Qy8</a>. Lightweight, durable though a bit plastic feeling. Very good sound quality. If they last the end of this journey, $25 from Amazon could be considered a good bargain. I wonder, how they would compare with <a href="http://www.jaybirdsport.com/x2-bluetooth-headphones/" target="_new">Jaybird X2 ($170)</a>? Seems to be some resemblances...

<h2>Markets and stores</h2>




<p class="letters"><a href="http://www.westsidemarket.org/" target="_New">West Side Market</a> is Cleveland´s Kauppahalli, although a bit bigger in size.

			<p class="letters"><a href="http://www.gianteagle.com/" target="_New">A Giant Eagle</a> is the closest to our supermarket´s like Citymarket. Being in the middle price range it also resembles our counterparts by similar looks (at least from inside). An interesting detail about the cheese. The cheapest cheese here is individually wrapped cheddar slices that in addition to their very unhealthy properties are served in awfully thick slices, meaning that one package doesn't last long. The chunks of cheese are much pricier. In addition, there are no ordinary cheese slicers anywhere. Just those for cutting very thick slices. Judging by this, a more paranoid person would see here an intentional guiding of buying behavior: in every case you eat lots of cheese, which is more money for cheese business and more fat craving people (vicious circle?). Fortunately there´s the internet.

<h2>Sporting</h2>

<p class="letters">There are three places in University Circle to play basketball of which the best (seen in pictures above) is reserved only for official teams. The second has a hideously hard and awfully non-slippery plastic carpet and the third has reportedly bad air conditioning. Have to hope that the last is just about somebody´s picky attitude. On the other hand, most of the courts are open every evening and the new plastic carpet is been installed during the christmas leave. Further, the games in <i>open series</i> are in the reasonable level for players like me. As said before, the gyms are ridiculously large and versatile, meaning no rush hours.</p>

<h2>Museums</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" target="_New">Cleveland Museum of Art</a> is almost exhaustively large attraction presenting art and artifacts from different times and places. Although high quality, there´s no mandatory charge to visit the most of the collections. </p>

<p><a href="http://mocacleveland.org" target="_New">Museum of Contemporary Art Cleveland</a> is a small labyrinthine museum with changing exhibitions. Currently three artists of which the most spectacular is Do Ho Suh´s detailed installation about his New York apartment. The installation is made of polyester fabric and stainless steel tubes.</p>

<p>Almost as big as the Museum of Art is the <a href="http://www.cmnh.org" target="_New">Cleveland Museum of Natural History</a>, but with more vivid exhibitions. Lots of high quality animal replicas and different sized diorama´s of different times. There´s a changing exhibition in every few months like the current <i>The World´s Largest Dinosaur</i>.

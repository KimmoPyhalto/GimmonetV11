					<h1>Letters from the Front - 1</h1>
					
					
					
				<p class="letters">This is the first report of my six month (1.11.2015-30.4.2016) visit to The United States. I am doing my dissertation research as a visiting <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program">Fulbright</a> scholar in <a target="_new" href="http://www.case.edu/">Case Western Reserve University</a> (CWRU, <a target="_new" href="https://weatherhead.case.edu/">Weatherhead School of Management</a>), Cleveland. As a Fulbrighter, my purpose here is to foster transnational exchange of knowledge and culture. Referring to this cultural exchange, the reason I chose the particular title is because compared to Finland there are many things here that seems to be quite different. It's not a warzone but variety of practical and ideological adjustments has to be made to be able to cope here. Not as a short-time tourist but as a local resident. Second, there's a hint of an inside humor in the title. Let's just hope that I'm getting out of here in one piece (knocking the wood). Structure and style of these reports will be short and succinct. Efficient sentences and lots of photographs with captions will be used to shorten the reports and to make my (and yours) life easier. So, let's begin from autumn 2014.</p>
					
				
				 


					
<h2>Applying for the Fulbright program and preliminaries for the journey</h2>

<p class="letters">Before actual <a target="_new" href="http://www.fulbright.fi/fi/asla-fulbright-pre-doctoral-research-fellows-program/stipendiohjelman-tarkempi-kuvaus-ja">application process</a> I had to search for American PhD student and university that would be interested of my study. Then, awfully long and multistage application process. King-sized application letter and invitation from the host university, minimum of three referees with their own credential letters, second phase with interview in Helsinki etc. Much more complicated than other funding applications I've been making before (and there's lots of them). Preparing for the trip was about searching medical records, having vaccinated (boy I'm lucky to be born in 1970's welfare state > all vaccination done, multiply), answering strange questions by visa authorities, visiting in Helsinki, again. Then, trying to find ways to find an apartment, waiting for delayed responses from the landlords, trying to interpret small photographs about the apartments. More questions, more delays. My flight took place at October 31th and by October 29th still no assurance where I'd be living. </p>

<h2>21 hours from Tampere to Cleveland</h2>




<p class="letters">OnniBus, the Finnish <i>greyhound</i> started the journey on 31.10.2015 at 8:45. Three SAS's flights (Helsinki, 12:45 - Arlanda, 15:30 - Chicago, 02:45 - Cleveland, 04:45) operated by three different carriers. Arriving <i>home</i> (<i>the box</i> now on) by 06:00. Very decent meals (meal + breakfast) during the long flight (Arlanda-Chicago) and great info/movie/game etc. screen for every passenger. There was also a working, bit slow Wi-Fi on board (10 &euro;). Had some great conversations with Swedish version of Patrick Stewart (no picture, sorry), a train mechanic going to Maui for wind surfing. 
Awfully long entry lines in <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Hare_International_Airport">Chicago (ORD) airport</a>. Luckily no strange questions or even worse... Flight bag (1 pc) was automatically transferred from plane to plane in Arlanda but in Chicago had to be taken through customs. No problems except a bit of tension if my <a target="_new" href="http://www.adusso.com/uxblackbox_tool">research equipment</a> would cause suspicions. No proper information in my boarding card or at the airport about the terminal, gate etc. Running like a mad and asking directions from the staff while running. Almost missing the flight. My flight bag wasn't so lucky and was brought to the box next day (the bag's mechanical security code was touched and probably the flight bag was opened at some point). A taxi driver who hardly speaks English and drives like an insane takes me to the apartment. Nausea and overtiredness due to long wake up time prevents me to sleep properly.</p>




<h2>First impressions</h2>

<p class="letters">I'm living at the campus area called <a target="_new" href="http://www.universitycircle.org/">The University Circle</a>. The <a target="_new" href="https://students.case.edu/living/facilities/pma/noble.html">apartment</a> is ca. 90 m<sup>2</sup>, it's rather old and the lease of mine, 650$/month might feel expensive, but it's <i>all included</i>. In America, usually almost all amenities (heat, gas, garbage, water, electricity, internet etc.) are being paid separately. When calculating the costs of just the proper internet connection (which in America are ridiculously expensive (3Mbps, 30$/month), or in fact, they are ridiculously cheap in Finland (10Mbps, 26&euro;/month)) the lease is in line with the market prices.</p>

<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp</div>


<p>The apartment is shared with two other guys (so, 650$*3=1950$/month). Although they are young (23 y, Chinese, second year master student, finance) and younger (less than 23 y, American, First year bachelor of arts, game graphics), they are quite decent guys. Judging from their personalities, there's no fear of having parties here.</p>

<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp</div>


<p> The University Circle is somewhat 9 km from the <a target="_new" href="http://www.cleveland.com">Cleveland</a> city (<a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland">population ca. 396000</a>) central and it has the majority of all universities in town (technology, medical, arts, business etc.). In addition to university services (library, administration etc.) it has all basic services like groceries, restaurants, and bars etc., which all being quite expensive. University Circle even has its own police forces located next to our block.</p>

<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp</div>


<p>Cheap food and other supplies like electronics can be found in other neighborhoods. There's only one really bad neighborhood (East) in Cleveland, although any part of the town without any services or attractions can be considered at least slightly hazardous. It's a fascinating feeling when you are jogging in the dark evening and find yourself in the middle of ghetto. The feelings and the amount of adrenaline that self-protection instinct gives you, are something very different than experienced in Finland. <i>A true fear in the concrete jungle.</i> Must have made my speed record that evening. </p>




<p class="letters">Although the University Circle itself is very safe, due to safety issues in "middle areas" a free <a target="_new" href="http://www.case.edu/access-services/shuttles/">shuttle (minibus) service</a> is provided for all CWRU students and staff. It's also a great way to use with those cheap grocery shops, because the portion sizes here are huge. For example, there's very little juice concentrates, just ready juices in 2 liter bottles and cheap chicken tights are usually sold in ca. 3 kg family packs. The package size is partly to explain (in addition to distances) the need of an own car, although here also seems to be high quality cycling facilities, like own lanes and buses with bike racks. The best (or the most sad) part is that the most natives are still using the car, so the lanes are usually quite empty.</p>

<p>About quality, compared to the Finnish standards, everything (food, cars, houses, know-how, food in McDonalds, burb..) below ultra-high price group feels a bit half-woolen. It seems that at some point when the competition is accelerated to the maximum it starts to correlate negatively with the quality. Small margins/profits force companies to decrease quality and properties (one reason to the large portion sizes e.g. very few shops selling craft beer in singles. Everything is in 4- or 6-packs). </p>

<div style="clear:both;">&nbsp</div>

<p class="letters">The competition and rush can also be seen in people's behavior. Wrapped inside some kind of a zone, people seem to be quite artificial and not reacting as used to. Talks about smiling and always polite society is overstated, though not totally faulty. The most conspicuous and as from the Finnish perspective, the most disruptive issue is that the society seems to be heavily divided. Low-level functions are done by black or Hispanic population and in university roster it's hard to find black employees. Buses are mainly used by the black people (and few poor university researchers). I would strongly recommend our Prime Minister Sipil&auml; and the government to visit here and to see, were their current "freedom" politics are leading us. In spite of this divide, some are still smiling when eyes meet. And when that happens, a total stranger smiling at you, the mood is heightened for the rest of the day (after a slight moment of awkwardness, I'm Finnish after all).</p>

<h2>Research</h2>

<p class="letters">The start in this matter was a total bummer. The main data collection method for my research, videotaping older people using online services at their homes, at their most suitable and natural context is a red cloth to the <a target="_new" href="https://research.case.edu/compliance/IRB.cfm">institutional review board (IRB)</a> that reviews and gives permission to every study including human participants (in Finland IRB is only used in medical studies and studies including very special participants like children and/or unorthodox data collection methods). In addition, reputedly American elderly would not approve the idea of somebody coming to record in their homes. The funny thing is, that although the officials are so strict about the ethical issues, there are no mandatory research ethics courses for master or PhD level students?!? Those wanting to conduct studies with human participants, have to accomplish web-based <a target="_new" href="https://research.case.edu/education/CREC.cfm">CREC program</a> that provides investigators documented training in the protection of human subjects in research (took 2,5 days for me to accomplish). Although a major loss, its not the end of the word. I'll be back on this issue as matters go forward.</p>

<h2>The Promised Land of the Beer and sun, while waiting the lake effect.</h2>

<p class="letters">Although this report might seem a bit pessimistic, there are also good things in America. One of them is the culture of craft beer. The enthusiasm to make fine beverages combined to the vast population and massive financing has brought a vast amount of high quality beers. Own hop gardens (although at risk to disappear from the way of more profitable vineyards), closed (airtight) and fully automated fermentation systems (remember that ultra-high price group) are something that at least Finnish (I almost could say European) breweries could only dream of. In addition, groceries can sell whatever alcoholic products they want and they really have taken the advantage of it (frankly, I almost started to cry for joy when first saw the selection in my near grocery). Bars and restaurants have usually a vasta mount of American beer brands in their taps and fridges (like in Finland we have our own brands like Karjala, Lapin Kulta etc.), so the European beer geek can spend a lots of quality time at the local, not so beer (or otherwise) sophisticated pub. But as always, there's a catch especially from the perspective of a dedicated beer taster. And again, it comes to the money and the profits. American beer is most often sold in 4- (heavier stuff) or in 6-packs (basic craft beer). The few single bottles are 0,65 l or bigger (6-10 $). In bars, they usually sell American pints which is 0,473 l (ca. 6,5 $) and the bottles from the fridge are almost the same (6-8 $) as bought in packs from stores (9-15 $). Ok, they are cheaper than in Europe (high quality, imported 0,65 l beer is 15-20 &euro;), but still when the idea is not to get drunk but to taste, this culture is not ideal for that (there are also some states that have prohibited selling single bottles because of increased drinking on the streets...what?!?). Luckily I have found few places that sell individual products and tasters (1,2 dl) in reasonable price, although they are too far away to visit by foot (6 km) and they are not easily accessible by public trasportation. Just have to hope that the winter stays away to allow me to use bicycle as long as possible. Here's a <a target="_new" href="http://zagster.com/cleveland/">bicycle renting service</a> ca. 200 m from my apartment (3$/h).</p>

<p>While waiting for the winter to come, a clear sky and daily temperatures around 20&deg;C have really been the delight after the Finnish autumn. But, when the winter hits into the Cleveland its going to be a <b>real winter</b>. Due to the location at the shore of <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie">Lake Erie</a> (oval shaped, 388 km x 92 km) the phenomenon called <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake-effect_snow"><i>lake effect</i></a> can bring a meter of snow in one night not to mention the winds blowing from the north.

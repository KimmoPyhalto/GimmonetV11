# GimmonetV11

Own webpages Ver. 11 - www.gimmo.net

- I have had my own pages since 1997 for introducing my projects, CV and more
- For myself its always a good place to try new technologies and layouts
- Techniques used in this project:
1. HTML5 (structure, markup), see e.g. index.html and indexc.html that is loaded into index.
2. CSS5 & SASS (e.g. background, shadow effects, opacity, viewport units, nesting, extending), see e.g. screen.scss
3. JavaScript & jQuery (e.g. partial page loadings and responsiveness), see e.g. basic_functions.js or responsives.js
(4. SSI includes were used for header and footer, but now those are removed since my service provider stopped supporting them.)

<h2>ICIS´15, Fort Worth</h2>




<p class="letters"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Information_Systems" target="_new">ICIS (International Conference of Information Systems)</a> is one of the most significant IS conferences in the world. With over 1000 academics it gives a major opportunity to see the latest development in IS research and to meet other colleagues. I didn't have a paper in the conference, just went to see others, to have an analytical and fruitful conversations and to enjoy the catering. During a discussion session for PhD students I was lucky to get seated beside the keynote speaker <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6508" target="_new">F. Warren McFarlan</a> from Harvard Business School who gave some intriguing insights about the world of research. Although academic and business worlds are seemingly quite different, they share many properties whose use will define the success of researcher or entrepreneur. In addition to event, also the weather was favorable, +22C and a clear sky.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/fort-worth" target="_new">Omni Fort Worth</a>, by far the most luxurious hotel I´ve ever been. Wall-sized windows in 12th floor, private SUV (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=black+cadillac+escalade&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8" target="_new">black Cadillac Escalade</a>) driver, gardens and pool areas at the roof.</p>

I already had problems to get my first back pack to the plane as a personal item (notice: for Spirit airlines <a href="https://customersupport.spirit.com/hc/en-us/articles/202096476-What-are-the-size-and-weight-limits-for-bags-" target="_new">(free) personal item is different than (paid) carry-on item</a>) and now I had two of them.</p>

			Despite of relatively small looking center, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas" target="_new">Fort Worth</a> is the popular city of 800K+ residents. Also being in the vicinity of Dallas has increased its popularity. This was the first time when I saw the wealth differences between cities. Compared to Cleveland, Fort Worth seemed to be much cleaner and in much better condition. Even in Finnish standards the city looks very decent. The situation was similar outside the center. I arrived to the <a href="https://www.dfwairport.com/" target="_new">Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport</a> and departed from <a href="http://www.dallas-lovefield.com/" target="_new">Dallas Love Field airport</a> (56 km from the hotel) just to see the nearby areas. Differences in population demography were clearly visible: majority of the people were white (62%) and Mexicans (34%) were those doing the low income jobs. Black people were clearly in the minority (19%), where in Cleveland the situation is almost reversed (white: 37%, Black: 53%, Hispanic/Latino: 10%).

				<h2>New York - christmas</h2>
		
<p class="letters">I really enjoyed the idea of having christmas alone, without any hassle with presents, christmas tree etc.. But while trying to experience all <i>the must</i> NY attractions in five days, in the middle of christmas, you really cannot avoid some hassle and exhaustion. The main observations about the city were constant rush and the amount of people despite the time of day. Streets continuing miles and miles with huge skyscrapers were something to stare like yokels in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=huuhaa+innanen&biw=1252&bih=591&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjt_ubr2IvKAhUFdz4KHbVzAZYQ_AUIBygC#" terget="_new">Innanen´s paintings</a>.

<p>The second highest observation deck in NY can be found from <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com" target="_new">Empire State Building</a>. The official observation deck is on 86th floor (320m, $32) and with extra fee ($20) you can go to the small 102nd floor observation deck (369m, windowed). The highest observation deck is in <a href="https://oneworldobservatory.com" target="_new">One World Trade Center</a>, though it is also an inside deck (386m). The Empire State Building seemed to be quite crowded even at the late evening (ca. 23).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intrepidmuseum.org" target="_new">The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum</a> is mainly located inside the huge aircraft carrier. Functions and history of the carrier and other sea, air and space related things are presented by restored rooms and different exhibitions. Veterans who were operating the ship will tell you details and practical measures aboard. In addition, you can go inside British Airways Concorde ($20 extra fee) and cruise missile submarine Growler. No going to the sub if you are claustrophobic or if you can´t go through a small bulkhead door (the staff will ask you these before letting you in). Good-sized and high quality museum worth of $24-$31 (w. Space Shuttle Pavilion).

<p><a href="http://www.moma.org" target="_new">Museum of Modern Art</a> has a large variety of works including different times and styles from traditional (modern) art to industrial design.

<p><a href="http://www.metmuseum.org" target="_new">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> is easy to describe. It has everything from all times. It´s grueling experience to go through all rooms and sections. I recommend to have <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/visit/museum-map" target="_new">a museum map</a> before starting the tour and to decide interesting sections beforehand. It will be a mistake to try to see everything at once.</p>

<p>After those tragicomic parks and woods in Cleveland, <a href="http://www.centralparknyc.org" target="_new">Central Park</a> gave a long wanted breeze from something living.

<p>About the distances and travelling it is basically mandatory to use some other means of travelling than just your feet. With Google Maps you can find how and when to go with bus or subway. One bus travel <a href="http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/howto_bus.htm" target="_new">costs $2,75</a> and you can pay it directly to the driver with exact change. On subway, there are ticket machines ($3 per run) in every station and you can use your credit card. Transferring subway-bus and bus-bus are valid for 2 hours, but changing from subway to another by changing station doesn´t work. My plan didn´t include the Statue of Freedom so I only went to the south corner of Manhattan to take few pictures. From the south corner it´s a walking distance to the One World Trade Center´s observation deck.</p>

<p>Coming back from NYC, I had some six hours to wait my connecting flight in Boston. Great +22C sunny weather was optimal for going movies. The newest Star Wars in <i>True 3D</i>. Although 3D-glasses were surprisingly light and comfortable, the movie was somewhat mediocre: light story line and too much purposeless hassle. Using not so known actors (at least not for me) was a big plus. Boston, at least in center area seemed to be quite clean and hassle free (perhaps the christmas day had something to do with it).</p>
